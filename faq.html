                                Absolutely. FreeToolHub processes all data locally in your browser. Your files, calculations, and personal information never leave your device. We don't have servers that store your data, and we don't transmit your information over the internet.

                                We don't track individual users or collect personal information. We use basic analytics to understand overall website usage (like page views and popular tools), but this information is anonymized and doesn't identify individual users. We don't use cookies for tracking purposes, and we don't share any data with third parties.

                                No, we don't store any files. All file processing happens in your browser's memory. When you upload a file for processing (like a PDF or image), it's loaded into your browser temporarily and processed locally. Once processing is complete and you download the result, the file is removed from memory. We have no servers that store user files.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                                File size limits depend on your device's memory and browser capabilities, not our website. Since all processing happens locally in your browser, very large files (several hundred megabytes or gigabytes) may take longer to process or could cause performance issues. For best results, we recommend keeping files under 100MB for PDFs and 50MB for images. If you encounter issues with large files, try processing smaller files or splitting them into batches.

                                Yes! If you install FreeToolHub as a Progressive Web App (PWA), many tools can work offline. The PWA caches essential files and tools, allowing you to use them without an internet connection. To install, look for the "Install App" prompt when visiting our site.

                                However, some tools that require online resources (like currency exchange rates or weather data) will need an internet connection to function fully.

                                Yes, all our calculators and tools use standard, validated algorithms and formulas. Financial calculators use standard financial formulas, scientific calculators follow mathematical conventions, and converters use accurate conversion rates. However, for critical decisions (especially financial or medical), we recommend consulting with professionals and using our tools as supplementary resources.
